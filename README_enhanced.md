# Zodiac Sign Finder

### Changes Done :

1. Added the splash screen before the startinh of main application.
2. And the splash will run for 5 sec and after this 5 sec are over, the main application window will open, where you can enter your D.O.B. and get to know about your Zodiac Sign.
3. For implementing this splash screen used the pyglet library in python, windowing, user interface event handling, Joysticks, OpenGL graphics, loading images and videos, and playing sounds and music.
4. Added the new library used for implemeting this splash screen in the requirements.txt.
5. Added splash.gif to the Images folder, which is our splash screen.

### Output :
